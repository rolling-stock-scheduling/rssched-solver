This algorithm is the product of a collaboration between Swiss Federal Railways SBB and ETH ZÃ¼rich with the goal to compute an optimized rolling stock scheduling.

The objectives are to minimize the number of rolling stock units and the travel distance of dead-head-trips, while meeting the dynamic passenger demand and still satisfying the maintenance regulations.

Our optimization approach combines local-search meta-heuristics and the classic network simplex for computing a minimum-cost circulation. Local search improves rolling stock schedules through small, local modifications, such as exchanging adjusting train compositions, or exchanging a sequence of service trips to another rolling stock vehicle. Simultaneously, the optimality of the network simplex ensures minimal overall costs.

# Usage

In the following, we describe how to use the solver-server with or without docker or how to solve a single instance.

To get started with the whole RSSched project, have a look at this [step-by-step instruction](https://github.com/rolling-stock-scheduling/.github/blob/main/getting_started.md).

## Deployment via Docker

- install the docker engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

- building the docker image (from the main directory):

  ```bash
  docker build --tag eth_scheduling_image .
  ```

- loading the image and running the server for the first time (removes old container of the same name):

  ```bash
  docker run --rm --env RAYON_NUM_THREADS=16 --publish 3000:3000 --name eth_scheduling_server eth_scheduling_image
  ```

- the server can use 16 threads and answers on port 3000.

- if the environment variable `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` is not set, the server will use as many threads as possible.

- short version (with a random name for the container):

  ```bash
  docker run -e RAYON_NUM_THREADS=16 -p 3000:3000 eth_scheduling_image
  ```

- stopping the docker container:

  ```bash
  docker stop eth_scheduling_server
  ```

- starting it again with

  ```bash
  docker start --attach eth_scheduling_server
  ```

- remove the container:

  ```bash
  docker container rm eth_scheduling_server
  ```

## Server Usage

- send `POST http://localhost:3000/solve` with a JSON body containing the input. After solving the solution is returned as JSON.

- send `GET http://localhost:3000/health` to see if the server is running.

- `Insomnia`, `Postman`, or `Bruno` can send this requests with a GUI.

- or `curl`:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @your/input.json http://localhost:3000/solve
  ```

## Single Run

- from the main directory, compile and run the program with:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin=single_run --release -- your/input_file.json
  ```

- limiting the number of thread:

  ```bash
    RAYON_NUM_THREADS=16 cargo run --bin=single_run --release -- your/input_file.json
  ```

## Start Server (without Docker)

- for the default port of 3000:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin=server --release
  ```

- limiting the number of thread:

  ```bash
  RAYON_NUM_THREADS=16 cargo run --bin=server --release
  ```

- for customized port:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin=server --release -- 4000
  ```

```

# Development

- install the rust compiler rustc and the rust package manager cargo via rustup: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following sub-projects:

### time

- provides the types DateTime and Duration

- DateTime:

  - represents a point in time including year, month, day, hour, minute, second

  - enriched by Earliest (- infinity) and Latest (+ infinity)

  - integer based, whole seconds is the smallest unit

- Duration:

  - represents non-negative time duration represented by hours, minutes, seconds

  - enriched by Infinity

- basic calculations:

  - DateTime - DateTime = Duration

  - DateTime + Duration = DateTime

  - ...

### model

- model for a rolling stock scheduling instance

- provides base types (Idx, Distance, Cost,...), VehicleTypes, Locations, Config, Network, as well as the functionality to (de)serialize from json

- see `model/resources/small_test_input.json` for an example input

- all this data stay constant during one run

- VehicleTypes:

  - provides VehicleTypes consisting of a VehicleTypeIdx, name, seats, capacity, and maximal formation length

- Locations:

  - stores the locations (name, optional day limit)

  - provides dead-head-trip information between two locations (distance and duration)

- Config:

  - stores additional instance parameters, e.g., shunting durations, maintenance limits, costs coefficients

- Network:

  - stores all nodes (service trips, maintenance slots, start and end depots)

  - provides connection between these nodes via can_reach(), predecessor(), successor()

#### solution

- defines a cyclic rolling stock Schedule consisting of

  - vehicles that are used (specified by their type)

  - for each vehicle the tour it is driving

  - for each node the train formation (coupled vehicles)

  - the next day mapping, describing which vehicle of day 1 becomes which vehicle of day 2, when the schedule is repeated

  - service trips nodes that are not fully covered (= not all passengers are satisfied) are organized in dummy tours

  - note that schedules do not store their objective value

- each vehicle drives a Tour, which consists of

  - the nodes it is driving

  - some stored information for fast calculations (e.g., the total dead head distance of the tour or the cost for the tour)

  - tours always start at a start_depot_node and end at a end_depot_node

  - in between are only service trips and maintenance nodes are allowed

  - for each consecutive nodes n1 and n2 of a tour n1 can reach n2 (see Network)

- a Path is a sequence of nodes, such that consecutive nodes can be reached, but it must not start nor end at a depot node

- a Segment is a pair of a start and a end node and represents a sub path of a tour

- TrainFormation is a ordered list of vehicles, index 0 is supposed to be the front of the formation

- a Vehicle consists of an Idx and a vehicle type

- Schedules can be serialized into Json objects which are the primary part of the algorithm's output

- tour modifications:

  - tours should be immutable, so each modification creates a modified copy

  - replace start/end depot

  - remove segment

  - insert path (and remove conflicting nodes)

- schedule modifications:

  - schedules should be immutable, so each modification creates a modified copy

  - spawn vehicles (given a path or a dummy tour)

  - delete a vehicle (replace it by a dummy tour)

  - add a path to the tour of a vehicle

  - fit_reassign: given a provider and a receiver vehicle as well as a segment of the provider's tour: tries to insert as many nodes of the segment to the receiver's tour without causing any conflicts

  - override_reassign: given a provider and a receiver vehicle as well as a segment of the provider's tour: insert the segment into the receiver's tour removing all conflicting nodes

#### objective framework

- an objective consists of a hierarchy of linear combinations (levels) of indicators of a schedule (called solution)

- to define a new objective first define all indicators for a given schedule (e.g. number of unserved passenger, total dead head distance, ...) by implementing the Indicator<Schedule> trait, which needs an evaluate and a name function

- the evaluate method must return a BaseValue, which could be Integer, Float or Duration

- linear combine multiple indicators to a level by choosing Coefficients (integer or float)

- each level must be either Integer, Float or Duration and the indicators cannot be mixed within the same level

- multiple levels form an hierarchical Objective, the first level is the most important one, ties are broken by the second level and so forth

- given an Objective instance, a solution (schedule) can be evaluated. This method consumes the schedule and returns an EvaluatedSolution object which consists of the schedule and an ObjectiveValue

- an ObjectiveValue is a Vector of BaseValues which matches the objective hierarchy and implements the Ord trait.

#### heuristic framework (work in progress)

- a generic solver trait, that each meta-heuristic-solver should implement

- local search framework (independent of the rolling stock scheduling problem)

  - there are three local improver implementations which can be chosen

#### solver

- min-cost-circulation algorithm via the rs_graph crate (using the network simplex)

- implementation of the local search meta-heuristic from the heuristics framework for the rolling stock scheduling problem

  - defines the neighborhood

  - initializes the local improver

  - defines the objective

#### server

- a simple HTTP-server using the create axum.

- there are two routes /health and /solve

- /health (GET) returns "Healthy"

- /solve (POST)

  - expects a valid rolling stock scheduling instance in json form in the body (see ```model/resources/small_test_input.json``` for an example input)

  - executes the solver to produce a good schedule

  - answers with the specified output json, containing the objective value, the final schedule, as well as some additional information (running time, number of theads, timestamp, hostname)

#### internal

- this is a playground for the developer

- has a main which is similar to the /solve function of the server

- here is the place to try test-objectives
